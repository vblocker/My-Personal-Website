			<li><h3>Healed through A.I. | The Age of A.I.</h3></li>
				<p>As AI can be used in different fields in the industry it’s not that new to see some of it being used for health care. The use of AI in helping those who are diagnosed with some kind of illness will be on its way to being released in the near future. The video I just watched shows an NFL player Tim Shaw who was later diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) in which all his muscles almost give up and his way of speaking is almost understandable. He had to give up being a football player due to his condition, even his speaking voice is unrecognizable unlike how he spoke before. In a way to help Mr. Shaw, they have to improve the voice recognition or rather program data that translates what Mr. Shaw was speaking. With the help of Google’s voice recognition programmers, they team up to program data that can recognize the words, Mr. Shaw said. A speech recognition programmer Mr. Dimitri Kanevsky, also developed communication applications he was deaf when he was still one year old. He valued communication and learned English when he was deaf so he never heard himself speak in his entire life. Mr. Dimitry uses AI-powered live transcribes to help him communicate, an AI-powered live transcribed is data using a voice or speech recognition; the sound of our voice is converted into a waveform. They have to gather voice data in order for them to start improving speech recognition in Google.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, can AI also help those patients who have an eye problem? Or maybe they can’t…? Some health problems can have a big effect on us, especially diabetes. Diabetes is one common health problem that can affect our loss of vision. The team composed of engineers and doctors they are thinking of possible ways to use the machines help to solve one of the leading health problems. </p>
				<p>They create a machine that can detect what was the problem that leads to foggy vision. This can help those who are having the same problem which is their foggy vision due to diabetes.</p>
				<p>Just by seeing AI creators looking for a way to improve the use of AI to help some patients. Creating machines and improving AI for better use is already a stepping stone to what more technologies can do. Making solutions to health problems using machines and AI to prevent further causes of some diseases that can affect our bodies.</p>
