			<li><h3>What will you improve/innovate/upgrade from the system developed?</h3></li>
				<p>AI can be upgraded through many more years; some innovations can be enhanced more since humanity is now using AI to be their virtual support. The systems development can be looked up to further experiments on what it can do to release a more accurate data program. Since we are now in the modern world everything that can be used is mostly AI’s, through speech recognition, avatars, and a clone of ourselves.</p>
				<p>Gathering some data to create a new program for another innovation of human health care. Innovation for health problems is a must as well, different kinds of diseases can be detected to unimproved machines can be a problem, so upgrading those existing machines or building a new one can be great for hospital facilities. It can also benefit healthcare facilities by less work and faster processes with the help of AI.</p>
				<p>Improving the use of prosthetics to move like how real body parts move. The AI that has data on how to detect movement through muscle control can be improved more. AI can be upgraded to better performance; it just needs time to be applied. That’s why we just have to be more patient about what can AI do more in the future.</p>
