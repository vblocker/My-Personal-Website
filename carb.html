			<li><h3>Love, art and stories: decoded | The Age of A.I.</h3></li>
				<p>This video shows the works of AI and how they were programmed by humans. It is fascinating to see how AI works; they now have the ability to talk back if they are being questioned, modifying the program and enhancing possible ways to communicate with virtual AI. Innovating devices that are attached to the mannequins in order for them to move a few parts; then creating a program that will enable them to talk whenever they are asked. Another way of using voice recognition is to enable communication with the AI. With the help of AI and innovative devices that merge together, it can create an AI as a virtual support for humans.</p>
				<p>Another use for AI is for the filming industry, letting AI make a script for the filming is a bit impossibleâ€¦? Some researchers or rather say film directors are letting the AI decide on what to write on the script. They will be willing to film a story based on what the AI decides and the outcome is quite amazing. The evolution of AI is still reaching its peak or its full potential in different aspects of the field, as long as it exists programmers are willing to experiment with the use of AI to be a huge help in the future. The AI writer has been in works in script writing for several years and it seems to be doing well so far.</p>
				<p>In the field of racing AI is still in help. Some programmers group themselves into two they prove what AI can provide them. Using an enhanced GPS to teach where the right path is and detect the road if the car is going to bump. Testing two different cars with different programs and determining which one is better is a bit of a challenge to the programmers. They challenge them to an AI test drive in which one of the two cars that are controlled by AI has the skill of a racer. Letting a person drive first into the starting line before letting the AI control the and let it overtake another car. The first team seemed to have passed the first test easily but the second team seemed to be troubled as their AI-controlled car bumped into a wall. Seeing the first team pass the first mission they made another challenge to achieve the speed record of a race car. They seem to have no difficulties with and finish the challenge easily. This just proves that AI is now useful in different industries and even proved its worth. </p>
