			<li><h3>How Far is Too Far? | The Age of A.I.</h3></li>
				<p>Developing new technologies is now the focus of some developers, thinking about making necessary things easy by innovating and creating programs that can be more useful in the future. One of them is creating Artificial Intelligence also known as AI. An AI is a program based on human features; it is just a clone version of ourselves. The video shows how the AI worked and how they were created, by the data programmed by a professional bioengineering. They created a program that is an AI version of a baby modeled after the programmers' daughter; it shows how difficult it is to make an AI that can react to everything like humans do. </p> 
				<p>They also create a virtual brain that is driven by neural networks a virtual, much simpler version of a human brain. An AI that can have almost the same intelligence as a human. Some parts of the video also talked about how to innovate a prosthetic arm that functions through muscle movement, it is difficult as well since the fingers move according to the muscle. With the help of AI and robotics, anything can be done as the programmer wants. Anything in overall AI is now a huge help to humanity they can be our emotional support, virtual friends, etc. anything we want them to be. </p> 
				<p>AI has already transformed different things in our lives, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to advanced vehicles and healthcare applications. These adjustments offer great benefits, improving efficiency, and convenience, and even saving lives. Since we are now focusing on improving everything through technology, programmers are now brainstorming on what more to innovate and create that can soon be introduced to the world. Though there might be harm in using AI, replacing human workers can lose their jobs due to robotics replacement. As AI is now everywhere around the world the possibility of it dominating us humans in any work might increase. The pros and cons gap might get bigger due to how we are now engulfed in virtual reality, talking to a clone version of someone or ourselves using AI.</p>
				<p>This concluded that AI is now a huge thing in everyone’s daily lives, using them for everything that they can do. As AI advances each day, month, or year, we will now get used to it. This helps us to solve complex problems, providing us with answers that we were seeking online. It can make us be more productive in life since we don’t have to look for answers for too long, the AI’s will provide us anything we ask for.</p>
