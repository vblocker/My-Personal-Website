			<li><h3>Using A.I. to build a better human | The Age of A.I.</h3></li>
				<p>The use of AI in creating machines to help people solve things is now a thing. Innovating new things, creating new designs for prosthetic use, using AI to have a strategy on new tracks for racing, and making a mask for firefighters that can help them enhance their vision from the smokey surroundings. Seeing the video of using AI to build a better human can us realize that there are still ways to make ourselves keep on doing our passion in life. Watching them introduce foot prosthetics that can move on by detecting the muscle movement of the leg. Putting a brain or a chip on the prosthetic leg so it can move whenever the user wants it to move.</p>
				<p>A person who loves to do rock climbing got into a bad accident causing him to be unable to do rock climbing. The use of AI can help to provide the missing part of our body, prosthetic acts as the missing piece can make us feel that we are still complete despite being plastic. Using AI as a strategic plan for races can be possible as well, showing a possible way how overtake an opponent on track. It’s a great choice to use AI for this type of thing but it can also be dangerous if the AI gives out impossible tricks. There are still consequences to using AI, but it can still be improved throughout the years.</p>
				<p>Aside from those machines, AI can also be used for firefighters’ work. Improving the use of their mask to be able to see in smokey areas, AI can also be used to visualize the vision of the mask. Attaching a camera that can detect a figure in its surroundings to avoid further accidents.</p>
				<p>AI proved to be a great help in any field as long as it can provide machines that can truly do what humans won’t be able to do. Knowing that A.I. technologies are developed and deployed properly is top to connecting the full potential for human enhancement. I hope that in the near future, we can see the full potential of AI in our lives.</p>
