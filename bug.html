			<li><h3>The 'Space Architects' of Mars | The Age of A.I.</h3></li>
				<p>Space architectures are well-known in the world for innovating machines that can withstand the space atmosphere. It might be a little difficult but over the years few machines have already passed through space. NASA is a well-known space researcher that sends off astronauts in order to study the planetary movements of the universe; their mission is to learn more about the universe, especially the planets that can be habitual and can plant few crops. Knowing that NASA might already have an idea of what the planetâ€™s atmosphere is like, they now have to focus on how can their machines withstand the gravity or planetary disasters.</p>
				<p>Seeing the video of some Architects who are willing to make a machine that can be used to build for Mars. NASA held a competition for whoever could make a building that could withstand the Mars disastrous happenings. The two teams then discuss their group project to create, Using the help of AI they plan to build an extraordinary building that can be useful on Mars. The two teams then started to build their very own architectural building with the help of machines. They were given time to build their own piece using a robot that was designed to project a 3D visual of their design. The robots that help them build their project print out cement and start moving according to the building design.</p>
				<p>The building then puts to test how strong they are made. Testing them into categories whether they are capable of withstanding the planet Mars's dangerous weather. The teams are ecstatic that their building is capable of it, sadly there can only be one winner. One team won due to the strong material used to build their project. Now we have a slight idea of what will happen in the future of the universe.</p>
