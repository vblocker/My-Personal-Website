				<p>AI is now the replacement for human workers; since AI is leading the world due to its working faster than a human. This is scary news to human workers as they might have thought that AI has the upper hand in any field in the industry. This AI might have the advantage of taking over the work of humans and this will become a serious problem for the worldâ€™s society. Though AI might have a lack of data that disabled them to function further it is still a threat to humanity. </p>
				<p>The first video shows the truck has view difficulties in reacting to its surroundings leading to an abnormal function of the truck. Though some might have a solution to this problem it will take them time to fix it and might do a few test drives before releasing it to be used. Some AI machines also make a few mistakes if not observed very well, there might be some instances that humans and AI can work together rather than AI replacing human work completely.</p>
				<p>We might not know that in the near future, these AI projects might do good and will completely replace the human from their work. So, if for now technology is still in the process of enhancing its capability to work better than today before sending it off.</p>
